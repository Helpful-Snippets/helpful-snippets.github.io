title: About me 
---

My name is Connor McKelvey and I am a Front-end developer based out of Orlando, Florida. I currently work as the Web Project Manager at the [Storage Group](http://storageinternetmarketing.com) and I spend most of my free time working side projects with my friends and business partners. When I am not working or work-playing, I try to find time to play guitar, write songs, watch Walking Dead or a variety of other show.

##About Helpful Snippets
Since I switched to the **dark side** from freelance development and got a 9-5, I found myself wasting a large amount of time doing repetitive tasks. To make things worse, within a month of getting my in-house gig, my 15 in. MacBook Pro kicked the bucket. For a developer that means hours upon hours of Dropbox Syncing, program downloads, and development environment configuration. 

Being a Front-end developer I thought to myself, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). So I went over to Github, forked Paul Irish's Dotfiles and began my configurations on my new, shiny Retina MBP. But I took it even further than my last configuration, I started right dozens of bash scripts and javascript bookmarklets to  relieve myself from the repetitive tasks that I was doing everyday. 

After about a week, I started adding those code snippets to a Gist on Github and tweeting links to share them with my friends. The problem was that I had no way of sharing any background or explanation for why I chose to make a particular snippet. Thus **Helpful Snippets** is born.
